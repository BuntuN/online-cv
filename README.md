I have made this into a Jekyll Theme. Checkout the live demo [buntu_cv](https://buntun.github.io/online-cv/), which is based on 
[webjeda](https://webjeda.com/online-cv/)

## Installation

* [Fork](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/fork) the repository
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.
* Your new site should be ready at `https://username.github.io/online-cv/`

Change all the details from one place: ``_data/data.yml``
